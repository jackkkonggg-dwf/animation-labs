## [2026-01-29] - US-001
- Added GSAP global defaults to `src/lib/gsap-config.ts`
- Global defaults: `ease: 'power3.out'` and `duration: 0.5`
- Files changed: `src/lib/gsap-config.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The gsap-config.ts file already existed with most plugins registered (ScrollTrigger, Draggable, InertiaPlugin, MotionPathPlugin, SplitText, ScrollSmoother, MorphSVGPlugin, DrawSVGPlugin, ScrambleTextPlugin, ScrollToPlugin, Observer)
  - Global defaults are set using `gsap.defaults()` inside the client-side check
  - Use `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` for typecheck since there's no typecheck script in package.json
  - ESLint shows warnings but no errors in this project configuration

## [2026-01-29] - US-002
- Added DWF Labs route to `src/lib/navigation-data.ts` with Animation Labs styling
- Created placeholder page at `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx` (structure coming in US-003)
- Route displays in main navigation menu with Showcase category
- Page accessible via direct URL navigation
- Files changed: `src/lib/navigation-data.ts`, `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The navigation system uses `src/lib/navigation-data.ts` to define all routes
  - Mobile menu component automatically renders routes from `NAVIGATION_DATA`
  - Route structure: `{ id, title, description, path, category, difficulty }`
  - Category 'Showcase' fits DWF Labs as a production demo page
  - agent-browser CLI is available via `pnpm dlx agent-browser` for browser testing
  - Screenshots saved to `/tmp/` for verification

## [2026-01-29] - US-003
- Created complete DWF Labs page structure with all 6 sections in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Hero section: Character/word split for animations, multi-layer parallax background (grid, shapes, particles), SVG corner accents
- Services section: Pinned badge, progress bar, 3 service cards with number badges and icons
- Stats section: Circular SVG progress indicators, stat counters with data-target attributes
- Portfolio section: 15 company cards in grid layout, infinite horizontal marquee placeholder
- News section: 6 article cards with date badges, thumbnail placeholders, and shine effect overlay
- CTA/Footer: View Ecosystem button, pattern gallery preview, footer with social links and legal links
- Applied Animation Labs theme: bg-zinc-950, orange-500 accents, uppercase tracking, corner accents
- All DWF content preserved from storyboard (services copy, stats numbers, portfolio companies, news articles)
- Typecheck passed, browser verified with full-page screenshot (5589px height showing all sections)
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Split text into span elements for character/word animations upfront (easier than splitting later)
  - Use data-target attributes on counter elements for count-up animations (JS reads these values)
  - SVG circles need strokeDasharray and strokeDashoffset calculated (circumference = 2 * PI * r)
  - Agent-browser requires separate commands: open, then screenshot --full (not in single command)
  - Dev server must run in background before agent-browser can connect
  - The cleanup pattern from CLAUDE.md is critical: Track ScrollTriggers array, kill in cleanup return

## [2026-01-29] - US-004
- Implemented Hero character text reveal animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added 'use client' directive to enable GSAP hooks
- Created heroRef and attached to Hero section with useRef
- Used useGSAP hook with scope: heroRef for proper cleanup
- Query .hero-title span elements (8 chars: D, W, F, space, L, A, B, S)
- Initial state: y: 100, opacity: 0, rotation: -5
- Animate to: y: 0, opacity: 1, rotation: 0
- Stagger: 0.03s per character, ease: back.out(1.7), delay: 0.2s
- Cleanup: killTweensOf on titleChars in return function
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Converting page.tsx from server to client component requires adding 'use client' directive
  - useGSAP hook with scope parameter ensures proper cleanup when component unmounts
  - useGSAP runs after component mount, perfect for page load animations
  - gsap.set() sets initial state before animation, prevents FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
  - back.out(1.7) creates snappy "overshoot" effect for dynamic feel
  - Browser console shows pre-existing hydration error (not related to GSAP changes)
  - agent-browser eval can verify animation state by checking computed styles

## [2026-01-29] - US-005
- Implemented Hero tagline word reveal animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Tagline already had word-level span elements from US-003 (7 words: New, Generation, Web3, Investor, &, Market, Maker)
- Added word reveal animation in same useGSAP hook as character reveal
- Initial state: y: 50, opacity: 0
- Animate to: y: 0, opacity: 1
- Stagger: 0.15s per word with 0.3s delay after character reveal starts
- Easing: power2.out, duration: 0.6s
- Cleanup: killTweensOf on taglineWords in return function
- Browser verified: all 7 words reach opacity 1 at origin (transform matrix identity)
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The word reveal animation shares the same useGSAP hook as character reveal (keeps related animations together)
  - Delay timing: 0.3s delay after character reveal gives visual separation between title and tagline
  - The stagger creates a cascading effect: each word appears 0.15s after the previous
  - power2.out is smoother than back.out for text (less "bounce" effect)
  - Browser eval can verify animation state by checking computed styles on all span elements
  - Use `Array.from()` with map in eval to get structured data from multiple elements

## [2026-01-29] - US-006
- Implemented Hero multi-layer parallax background animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added parallax-layer-1 through parallax-layer-4 CSS classes to existing HTML layers
- Layer 1 (grid pattern): y: 100px, speed: 0.2
- Layer 2 (crypto symbols - circles, hexagons, lines): y: 250px, speed: 0.5
- Layer 3 (data particles): y: 400px, speed: 0.8
- Layer 4 (text/content): y: 500px, speed: 1.0
- All layers use scrub: 1 for smooth catch-up effect, ease: none
- ScrollTrigger start: 'top top', end: 'bottom top'
- Cleanup: Collect all ScrollTriggers in array, kill in return function
- Typecheck passed, browser verified (all 4 parallax layers present in compiled HTML)
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Parallax layers already existed in HTML from US-003, just needed GSAP animations
  - Different y distances create relative speed effect: larger y = faster apparent movement
  - scrub: 1 creates smooth catch-up effect tied to scroll position
  - ease: none prevents easing from interfering with the scroll-synced animation
  - ScrollTrigger cleanup requires tracking instances created in the useGSAP hook
  - Use `ScrollTrigger.getAll()` with trigger/contains check to find relevant instances
  - agent-browser session flag (--session) prevents browser conflicts between commands
