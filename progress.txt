## [2025-01-28] - US-001
- Created src/types/pattern.ts with Pattern, PatternCategory, Difficulty, and CodeSnippet types
- Types provide structure for pattern metadata including id, title, description, path, category, difficulty, and code snippets
- Build and typecheck passed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing types are in src/types/ (e.g., navigation.ts) - pattern types follow this convention
  - Build command `npm run build` handles TypeScript checking - no separate typecheck script configured
  - Existing NavigationRoute interface has similar structure to Pattern - consider if Pattern should extend or be separate

## [2025-01-28] - US-002
- Created src/lib/patterns-data.ts with PATTERN_CATEGORIES export
- Defined 12 categories with id, title, icon (emoji), and description
- Categories: ScrollTrigger Basics, Horizontal Scroll, Text Animations, Parallax & Depth, Page Transitions, Micro-interactions, Timelines, SVG Animations, Draggable, Advanced Scroll, Performance, Real-world Examples
- Added helper functions: getCategoryById(), CATEGORY_GROUPS, CATEGORY_COUNT
- Build and typecheck passed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Category IDs use kebab-case for consistency with URL routing
  - Emojis are used for icons for simplicity (e.g., 📜 for ScrollTrigger Basics)
  - Helper functions like getCategoryById() are useful for data access patterns
  - CATEGORY_GROUPS const provides logical grouping by difficulty level
  - Using 'as const' assertion on CATEGORY_GROUPS for type safety

## [2025-01-28] - US-003
- Created src/app/patterns/fade-reveal/page.tsx as the entry point for the pattern page
- Created src/components/patterns/fade-reveal-pattern.tsx with full implementation
- Pattern page structure: Header (title, description, badges), Live Demo (6 animated cards), Code Viewer (syntax highlighted), Key Concepts (4 explanation cards), Footer CTA
- Live demo uses gsap.set() for initial state (opacity: 0, y: 60) and gsap.to() with stagger: 0.15 for fade reveal animation
- Code viewer includes inline syntax-highlighted JSX using colored span elements
- Copy to clipboard button with visual feedback (scan line effect on hover, "Copied!" state)
- Proper cleanup in useGSAP return function: gsap.killTweensOf(elements)
- Follows industrial orange design system: zinc-950 background, zinc-900 cards, orange-500 accent
- Visual motifs: corner accents, diagonal stripe decorations, scan line effects, grid pattern overlays
- Build and typecheck passed, browser verified
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern pages should follow this structure: Header → Live Demo → Code Viewer → Key Concepts → CTA
  - Use separate span elements for syntax highlighting rather than complex nested braces to avoid JSX parsing issues
  - The scan line animation uses @keyframes scan defined in globals.css with animate-scan class
  - Grid pattern overlays use the grid-pattern-overlay class from globals.css
  - Code viewer should include a "Copied!" state with timeout reset for better UX
  - useGSAP cleanup should call gsap.killTweensOf() with the same selector used for animation

## [2025-01-28] - US-004
- Created src/app/patterns/scale-reveal/page.tsx as the entry point for the scale reveal pattern page
- Created src/components/patterns/scale-reveal-pattern.tsx with full implementation
- Scale reveal pattern: elements scale up from 0.8 to 1 with elastic.out(1, 0.5) easing
- Live demo uses gsap.set() for initial state (scale: 0.8, opacity: 0) and gsap.to() with stagger: 0.12
- Elastic easing creates spring-like bounce effect with overshoot: first param (1) controls amplitude, second (0.5) controls decay
- Code viewer with syntax-highlighted TypeScript/JSX code showing scale animation pattern
- Copy to clipboard button with scan line hover effect and "Copied!" state feedback
- Proper cleanup: gsap.killTweensOf(cards) in useGSAP return function
- 6 demo cards explaining elastic easing concepts: ELASTIC EASING, SCALE RANGE, OVERSHOOT, OSCILLATION, COMBINE WITH FADE, PERFORMANCE
- 4 key concept cards explaining: elastic easing parameters, duration importance, scale start point, combining animations
- Follows same industrial orange design system: zinc-950 background, zinc-900 cards, orange-500 accents, corner accents, diagonal stripes
- Build and typecheck passed, browser verified
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Elastic easing needs more time (0.8s+) than other easings to complete the bounce animation
  - Starting scale at 0.8 creates room for the overshoot effect (can go up to ~1.05)
  - Scale animations are GPU-accelerated and very performant - good choice for many elements
  - Elastic.out(1, 0.5) parameters: first is amplitude (overshoot), second is decay (settle speed)
  - Scale works beautifully combined with opacity fade for enhanced depth perception

## [2025-01-28] - US-005
- Created src/app/patterns/staggered-reveal/page.tsx as the entry point for the staggered reveal pattern page
- Created src/components/patterns/staggered-reveal-pattern.tsx with full implementation
- Staggered reveal pattern: elements slide in from left (x: -100 to 0) with 0.15s stagger delay between each
- Live demo uses gsap.set() for initial state (x: -100, opacity: 0) and gsap.to() with stagger: 0.15, power2.out easing
- power2.out easing provides smooth deceleration that feels natural for slide-in effects
- Code viewer with syntax-highlighted TypeScript/JSX code showing stagger animation pattern
- Copy to clipboard button with scan line hover effect and "Copied!" state feedback
- Proper cleanup: gsap.killTweensOf(cards) in useGSAP return function
- 8 demo cards in 4-column grid explaining stagger concepts: STAGGER DELAY, SEQUENCE ORDER, SLIDE DIRECTION, FADE COMBINATION, EASING CHOICE, GRID LAYOUTS, TIMING CONTROL, LARGE COLLECTIONS
- 4 key concept cards explaining: stagger value, direction control, grid layouts, advanced stagger options (from, grid)
- Follows same industrial orange design system: zinc-950 background, zinc-900 cards, orange-500 accents, corner accents, diagonal stripes
- Build and typecheck passed, browser verified
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Stagger delay of 0.15s creates a balanced cascade - lower (0.1) for faster, higher (0.3) for more dramatic effects
  - x: -100 creates left-to-right slide-in; x: 100 creates right-to-left; y for vertical movement
  - Stagger naturally follows DOM order in CSS Grid - left to right, top to bottom
  - Advanced stagger object form: { each: 0.15, from: "center" } or { from: "edges", grid: [rows, cols] }
  - power2.out is excellent for slide animations - smooth deceleration feels more natural than linear
