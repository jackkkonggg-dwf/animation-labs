## [2026-01-28] - US-001
- Registered GSAP bonus plugins in src/lib/gsap-config.ts: SplitText, ScrollSmoother, InertiaPlugin, MorphSVGPlugin, DrawSVGPlugin, ScrambleTextPlugin, ScrollToPlugin, Observer
- All plugins registered client-side only with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` check
- Build and typecheck passed successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SnapPlugin is NOT a separate GSAP module - the snap functionality is built into Draggable itself
  - GSAP bonus plugins are imported from `gsap/PluginName` (e.g., `gsap/SplitText`)
  - Draggable uses a different import pattern: `import Draggable from 'gsap/src/Draggable'`
  - TypeScript type definitions are available in `node_modules/gsap/types/` with kebab-case names (e.g., `split-text.d.ts`)

## [2026-01-28] - US-002
- Created PerformanceMetrics component at src/components/PerformanceMetrics.tsx
- Real-time FPS counter using requestAnimationFrame with rolling average of last 10 measurements
- GSAP metrics tracking: active timelines (via gsap.globalTimeline.getChildren()), ScrollTrigger count, total animation duration
- Toggle show/hide functionality with persistent button when collapsed
- Color-coded performance: green (>50 FPS), yellow (30-50), red (<30) with status text (EXCELLENT/GOOD/POOR)
- Matches design system with zinc-900/95 backgrounds, orange-500 accents, corner accents
- Test page created at src/app/test-performance-metrics/ for browser verification
- Browser verification completed via agent-browser - screenshots captured showing component working correctly
- Build and typecheck passed successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gsap.globalTimeline.getChildren() returns array of active animations/timelines - filter with isActive() for currently running
  - ScrollTrigger.getAll() returns array of all ScrollTrigger instances
  - For FPS calculation, update every 500ms with frame counting for stable readings
  - agent-browser skill is invoked via `Skill` tool, not bash command - but pnpm dlx agent-browser works for direct CLI access
  - Playwright chromium must be installed separately via `pnpm dlx playwright install chromium`
  - The component should be exportable from a barrel file (e.g., src/components/index.ts) for easier imports in future demos
