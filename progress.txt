## [2026-01-29] - US-001
- Added GSAP global defaults to `src/lib/gsap-config.ts`
- Global defaults: `ease: 'power3.out'` and `duration: 0.5`
- Files changed: `src/lib/gsap-config.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The gsap-config.ts file already existed with most plugins registered (ScrollTrigger, Draggable, InertiaPlugin, MotionPathPlugin, SplitText, ScrollSmoother, MorphSVGPlugin, DrawSVGPlugin, ScrambleTextPlugin, ScrollToPlugin, Observer)
  - Global defaults are set using `gsap.defaults()` inside the client-side check
  - Use `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` for typecheck since there's no typecheck script in package.json
  - ESLint shows warnings but no errors in this project configuration

## [2026-01-29] - US-002
- Added DWF Labs route to `src/lib/navigation-data.ts` with Animation Labs styling
- Created placeholder page at `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx` (structure coming in US-003)
- Route displays in main navigation menu with Showcase category
- Page accessible via direct URL navigation
- Files changed: `src/lib/navigation-data.ts`, `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The navigation system uses `src/lib/navigation-data.ts` to define all routes
  - Mobile menu component automatically renders routes from `NAVIGATION_DATA`
  - Route structure: `{ id, title, description, path, category, difficulty }`
  - Category 'Showcase' fits DWF Labs as a production demo page
  - agent-browser CLI is available via `pnpm dlx agent-browser` for browser testing
  - Screenshots saved to `/tmp/` for verification

## [2026-01-29] - US-003
- Created complete DWF Labs page structure with all 6 sections in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Hero section: Character/word split for animations, multi-layer parallax background (grid, shapes, particles), SVG corner accents
- Services section: Pinned badge, progress bar, 3 service cards with number badges and icons
- Stats section: Circular SVG progress indicators, stat counters with data-target attributes
- Portfolio section: 15 company cards in grid layout, infinite horizontal marquee placeholder
- News section: 6 article cards with date badges, thumbnail placeholders, and shine effect overlay
- CTA/Footer: View Ecosystem button, pattern gallery preview, footer with social links and legal links
- Applied Animation Labs theme: bg-zinc-950, orange-500 accents, uppercase tracking, corner accents
- All DWF content preserved from storyboard (services copy, stats numbers, portfolio companies, news articles)
- Typecheck passed, browser verified with full-page screenshot (5589px height showing all sections)
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Split text into span elements for character/word animations upfront (easier than splitting later)
  - Use data-target attributes on counter elements for count-up animations (JS reads these values)
  - SVG circles need strokeDasharray and strokeDashoffset calculated (circumference = 2 * PI * r)
  - Agent-browser requires separate commands: open, then screenshot --full (not in single command)
  - Dev server must run in background before agent-browser can connect
  - The cleanup pattern from CLAUDE.md is critical: Track ScrollTriggers array, kill in cleanup return
