## [2025-01-28] - US-001
- Created src/types/pattern.ts with Pattern, PatternCategory, Difficulty, and CodeSnippet types
- Types provide structure for pattern metadata including id, title, description, path, category, difficulty, and code snippets
- Build and typecheck passed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing types are in src/types/ (e.g., navigation.ts) - pattern types follow this convention
  - Build command `npm run build` handles TypeScript checking - no separate typecheck script configured
  - Existing NavigationRoute interface has similar structure to Pattern - consider if Pattern should extend or be separate

## [2025-01-28] - US-002
- Created src/lib/patterns-data.ts with PATTERN_CATEGORIES export
- Defined 12 categories with id, title, icon (emoji), and description
- Categories: ScrollTrigger Basics, Horizontal Scroll, Text Animations, Parallax & Depth, Page Transitions, Micro-interactions, Timelines, SVG Animations, Draggable, Advanced Scroll, Performance, Real-world Examples
- Added helper functions: getCategoryById(), CATEGORY_GROUPS, CATEGORY_COUNT
- Build and typecheck passed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Category IDs use kebab-case for consistency with URL routing
  - Emojis are used for icons for simplicity (e.g., 📜 for ScrollTrigger Basics)
  - Helper functions like getCategoryById() are useful for data access patterns
  - CATEGORY_GROUPS const provides logical grouping by difficulty level
  - Using 'as const' assertion on CATEGORY_GROUPS for type safety
