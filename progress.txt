## [2026-01-29] - US-001
- Added GSAP global defaults to `src/lib/gsap-config.ts`
- Global defaults: `ease: 'power3.out'` and `duration: 0.5`
- Files changed: `src/lib/gsap-config.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The gsap-config.ts file already existed with most plugins registered (ScrollTrigger, Draggable, InertiaPlugin, MotionPathPlugin, SplitText, ScrollSmoother, MorphSVGPlugin, DrawSVGPlugin, ScrambleTextPlugin, ScrollToPlugin, Observer)
  - Global defaults are set using `gsap.defaults()` inside the client-side check
  - Use `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` for typecheck since there's no typecheck script in package.json
  - ESLint shows warnings but no errors in this project configuration
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-002
- Added DWF Labs route to `src/lib/navigation-data.ts` with Animation Labs styling
- Created placeholder page at `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx` (structure coming in US-003)
- Route displays in main navigation menu with Showcase category
- Page accessible via direct URL navigation
- Files changed: `src/lib/navigation-data.ts`, `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The navigation system uses `src/lib/navigation-data.ts` to define all routes
  - Mobile menu component automatically renders routes from `NAVIGATION_DATA`
  - Route structure: `{ id, title, description, path, category, difficulty }`
  - Category 'Showcase' fits DWF Labs as a production demo page
  - agent-browser CLI is available via `pnpm dlx agent-browser` for browser testing
  - Screenshots saved to `/tmp/` for verification
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-003
- Created complete DWF Labs page structure with all 6 sections in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Hero section: Character/word split for animations, multi-layer parallax background (grid, shapes, particles), SVG corner accents
- Services section: Pinned badge, progress bar, 3 service cards with number badges and icons
- Stats section: Circular SVG progress indicators, stat counters with data-target attributes
- Portfolio section: 15 company cards in grid layout, infinite horizontal marquee placeholder
- News section: 6 article cards with date badges, thumbnail placeholders, and shine effect overlay
- CTA/Footer: View Ecosystem button, pattern gallery preview, footer with social links and legal links
- Applied Animation Labs theme: bg-zinc-950, orange-500 accents, uppercase tracking, corner accents
- All DWF content preserved from storyboard (services copy, stats numbers, portfolio companies, news articles)
- Typecheck passed, browser verified with full-page screenshot (5589px height showing all sections)
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Split text into span elements for character/word animations upfront (easier than splitting later)
  - Use data-target attributes on counter elements for count-up animations (JS reads these values)
  - SVG circles need strokeDasharray and strokeDashoffset calculated (circumference = 2 * PI * r)
  - Agent-browser requires separate commands: open, then screenshot --full (not in single command)
  - Dev server must run in background before agent-browser can connect
  - The cleanup pattern from CLAUDE.md is critical: Track ScrollTriggers array, kill in cleanup return
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-004
- Implemented Hero character text reveal animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added 'use client' directive to enable GSAP hooks
- Created heroRef and attached to Hero section with useRef
- Used useGSAP hook with scope: heroRef for proper cleanup
- Query .hero-title span elements (8 chars: D, W, F, space, L, A, B, S)
- Initial state: y: 100, opacity: 0, rotation: -5
- Animate to: y: 0, opacity: 1, rotation: 0
- Stagger: 0.03s per character, ease: back.out(1.7), delay: 0.2s
- Cleanup: killTweensOf on titleChars in return function
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Converting page.tsx from server to client component requires adding 'use client' directive
  - useGSAP hook with scope parameter ensures proper cleanup when component unmounts
  - useGSAP runs after component mount, perfect for page load animations
  - gsap.set() sets initial state before animation, prevents FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
  - back.out(1.7) creates snappy "overshoot" effect for dynamic feel
  - Browser console shows pre-existing hydration error (not related to GSAP changes)
  - agent-browser eval can verify animation state by checking computed styles
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-005
- Implemented Hero tagline word reveal animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Tagline already had word-level span elements from US-003 (7 words: New, Generation, Web3, Investor, &, Market, Maker)
- Added word reveal animation in same useGSAP hook as character reveal
- Initial state: y: 50, opacity: 0
- Animate to: y: 0, opacity: 1
- Stagger: 0.15s per word with 0.3s delay after character reveal starts
- Easing: power2.out, duration: 0.6s
- Cleanup: killTweensOf on taglineWords in return function
- Browser verified: all 7 words reach opacity 1 at origin (transform matrix identity)
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The word reveal animation shares the same useGSAP hook as character reveal (keeps related animations together)
  - Delay timing: 0.3s delay after character reveal gives visual separation between title and tagline
  - The stagger creates a cascading effect: each word appears 0.15s after the previous
  - power2.out is smoother than back.out for text (less "bounce" effect)
  - Browser eval can verify animation state by checking computed styles on all span elements
  - Use `Array.from()` with map in eval to get structured data from multiple elements
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-006
- Implemented Hero multi-layer parallax background animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added parallax-layer-1 through parallax-layer-4 CSS classes to existing HTML layers
- Layer 1 (grid pattern): y: 100px, speed: 0.2
- Layer 2 (crypto symbols - circles, hexagons, lines): y: 250px, speed: 0.5
- Layer 3 (data particles): y: 400px, speed: 0.8
- Layer 4 (text/content): y: 500px, speed: 1.0
- All layers use scrub: 1 for smooth catch-up effect, ease: none
- ScrollTrigger start: 'top top', end: 'bottom top'
- Cleanup: Collect all ScrollTriggers in array, kill in return function
- Typecheck passed, browser verified (all 4 parallax layers present in compiled HTML)
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Parallax layers already existed in HTML from US-003, just needed GSAP animations
  - Different y distances create relative speed effect: larger y = faster apparent movement
  - scrub: 1 creates smooth catch-up effect tied to scroll position
  - ease: none prevents easing from interfering with the scroll-synced animation
  - ScrollTrigger cleanup requires tracking instances created in the useGSAP hook
  - Use `ScrollTrigger.getAll()` with trigger/contains check to find relevant instances
  - agent-browser session flag (--session) prevents browser conflicts between commands
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-008
- Implemented Services pinned section with progress bar in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added `servicesRef` with useRef to track Services section DOM element
- Created separate useGSAP hook with scope: servicesRef for proper cleanup
- ScrollTrigger pin configuration: pin for 3000px of scroll (end: '+=3000'), scrub: 1, start: 'top center'
- Progress bar animation: width from 0% to 100%, ease: none, synchronized with scroll position
- Pin indicator badge toggles text content: 'Pinned Section' → 'PINNED' when active, back to 'Pinned Section' when inactive
- Browser verified: badge changes 'Pinned Section'/'PINNED', progress bar 0% → 100% during scroll
- Cleanup: kill all ScrollTriggers and tweens in return function
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ScrollTrigger.create() returns the trigger instance that must be tracked for cleanup
  - onToggle callback provides self.isActive boolean indicating whether the trigger is currently active
  - Pin section requires separate ScrollTrigger for progress bar (scrub animation linked to same trigger)
  - Pin duration (3000px) creates a "virtual scroll distance" - section stays pinned while user scrolls this virtual distance
  - scrub: 1 creates smooth catch-up animation tied to scroll position
  - When using multiple ScrollTriggers on same element, collect all for cleanup (some created by gsap.to, some by ScrollTrigger.create)
  - Browser verification: scroll through the full pin range to verify progress bar reaches 100%
  - agent-browser eval returns strings - use JSON.stringify() for complex objects
  - The badge text content toggle in onToggle requires querySelector inside the callback (DOM must be queried each time)

## [2026-01-29] - US-009
- Implemented Services staggered card reveal animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added card reveal animation to existing servicesRef useGSAP hook (same as US-008)
- 3 service cards with class `.service-card`: Market Making (chart icon), OTC Trading (exchange icon), Ventures (rocket icon)
- Initial state: y: 100, opacity: 0, scale: 0.9
- Animate to: y: 0, opacity: 1, scale: 1
- Stagger: 0.3s per card, ease: back.out(1.2), duration: 0.8s
- ScrollTrigger: start: 'top center', toggleActions: 'play none none reverse'
- Browser verified: cards start at opacity 0/scale 0.9/y 100, animate to opacity 1/scale 1/y 0 with stagger
- Cleanup: killTweensOf on serviceCards in return function
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Service cards already existed in HTML from US-003 with `.service-card` class
  - Card reveal animation uses ScrollTrigger with toggleActions: 'play none none reverse' for enter/exit behavior
  - start: 'top center' triggers animation when services section enters viewport center
  - The card reveal is in the same useGSAP hook as the pin animation (US-008) since they operate on the same section
  - back.out(1.2) creates subtle overshoot for snappy feel (less aggressive than back.out(1.7) used for hero text)
  - stagger: 0.3s means each card animates 300ms after the previous one
  - Agent-browser verification: check computed styles for opacity and transform matrix before/after animation
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-010
- Implemented Services icon animations with color transform in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- 3 service icons (.service-icon svg) animate with scale 1→1.2, rotation 0→360deg, color zinc-700→orange-500
- Animation stagger: 0.2s per icon, ease: back.out(1), duration: 0.6s
- Same ScrollTrigger as card reveal (start: 'top center', toggleActions: 'play none none reverse')
- Initial state: gsap.set with color: '#3f3f46' (zinc-700)
- Animate to: scale: 1.2, rotation: 360, color: '#f97316' (orange-500)
- Browser verified: icons reach scale 1.2, orange-500 color, rotation complete (360° = 0° visually)
- Cleanup: killTweensOf on serviceIcons in return function
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Service icons are SVG elements inside .service-icon divs, queryable via `.service-icon svg`
  - GSAP color property requires hex codes, not Tailwind class names (zinc-700 = '#3f3f46', orange-500 = '#f97316')
  - Rotation of 360° completes at same visual position as 0°, transform matrix shows scale 1.2
  - Icon animation shares same ScrollTrigger as card reveal for synchronized timing
  - When animating SVG elements, use the SVG element itself (not wrapper div) for rotation/scale to center correctly

## [2026-01-29] - US-011
- Implemented Stats count up animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added `statsRef` with useRef to track Stats section DOM element
- Created separate useGSAP hook with scope: statsRef for proper cleanup
- Counters animate: 0 to 800 (Projects), 0 to 10 (CMC Top 100), 0 to 20 (CMC Top 1000)
- Duration: 2 seconds, easing: power2.out, snap: { value: 1 } for whole integers
- ScrollTrigger: start: 'top center', toggleActions: 'play none none reverse'
- Each counter uses a counterObj with value property, onUpdate updates textContent with Math.round(counterObj.value)
- Target values read from data-target attributes on .stat-value elements
- Typecheck passed
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - For counting up numbers, animate a proxy object (counterObj) rather than the DOM element directly
  - Use onUpdate callback to update the actual DOM textContent with the current animated value
  - snap: { value: 1 } ensures numbers only show whole integers (no decimals)
  - data-target attributes on elements store the final target value for the animation
  - parseInt() converts the string from dataset.target to a number for GSAP to animate
  - Math.round() in onUpdate ensures the displayed value is always an integer
  - ToggleActions: 'play none none reverse' allows the animation to reverse when scrolling back up
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-012
- Implemented Stats scrub timeline and icon transforms in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added separate useGSAP hook with timeline and scrub: 1 for scroll-synced animation
- Icon transforms: scale 1.0 → 1.3, rotation 0deg → 45deg, zinc-700 → orange-500
- ScrollTrigger: start 'top center', end 'bottom center', scrub: 1
- Stagger: 0.2s per icon for sequential effect, ease: power2.out
- Animation verified to reverse on scroll up
- Browser verified: icons reach scale ~1.3, 45° rotation, orange-500 color at end of scrub
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `gsap.timeline()` with `scrollTrigger` containing `scrub: 1` to link animation progress to scroll position
  - Scrub animations automatically reverse when scrolling back up (unlike toggleActions which requires explicit reverse)
  - When animating SVG color, use hex codes: zinc-700 = '#3f3f46', orange-500 = '#f97316'
  - Transform matrix for 45° rotation with scale 1.3: matrix(0.919239, 0.919239, -0.919239, 0.919239, 0, 0)
  - ScrollTrigger 'start: top center' triggers when the element's top edge reaches the viewport center
  - Separate useGSAP hooks for different animation types (count up vs scrub) keeps concerns clear
  - Browser verification: eval transform matrix to verify scale (√(a² + b²)) and rotation (atan2(b, a))
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-013
- Implemented Stats circular SVG progress indicators in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added animation to existing US-011 count up hook for synchronization
- SVG circles with class `.stat-progress-circle` animate strokeDashoffset from 351.86 (circumference) to 0 (full circle)
- Circle radius: 56, circumference: 2 * π * 56 ≈ 351.86
- Duration: 2s, ease: power2.out, synchronized with count up animation
- Each stat has its own circle animated alongside its counter (index-based matching)
- ScrollTrigger: start: 'top center', toggleActions: 'play none none reverse'
- Browser verified: strokeDashoffset reaches 0px (full) after animation, returns to ~352px (empty) on reverse scroll
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SVG circle progress animation uses strokeDasharray (circumference) and strokeDashoffset (hidden portion)
  - strokeDashoffset = circumference = empty (no visible stroke), strokeDashoffset = 0 = full circle
  - Circumference formula: 2 * π * r (for r=56, circumference ≈ 351.86)
  - Index-based matching works when elements are in the same order: `progressCircles[index]` pairs with `statValues[index]`
  - The progress circles were already in HTML from US-003 with correct attributes, just needed GSAP animation
  - agent-browser eval requires IIFE wrapper `(() => { ... })()` for complex JS (can't use bare return statement)
  - Browser verification: wait 2-3s after scroll trigger for animation to complete before checking computed styles
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-014
- Implemented Portfolio grid batch reveal animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added `portfolioRef` with useRef to track Portfolio section DOM element
- Created separate useGSAP hook with scope: portfolioRef for proper cleanup
- 15 portfolio cards with class `.portfolio-card`: TRON, Algorand, Notcoin, Mantle, Jupiter, TON, Gala, Celo, Fetch.ai, YGG, Beam, Sonic, WLFI, Vaultek, Floki
- Used `ScrollTrigger.batch()` for efficient batch animation of multiple elements
- Initial state: y: 60, opacity: 0, scale: 0.95
- Animate to: y: 0, opacity: 1, scale: 1
- Stagger: 0.08s per card, ease: power3.out, duration: 0.6s
- Implemented all 4 batch callbacks: onEnter, onLeave, onEnterBack, onLeaveBack for proper scroll behavior
- Start position: 'top center'
- Browser verified: cards reach opacity 1, scale 1, y 0 after scroll trigger
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `ScrollTrigger.batch()` is more efficient than individual ScrollTriggers for multiple similar elements
  - Batch accepts 4 callbacks: onEnter (scrolling down), onLeave (scrolling past), onEnterBack (scrolling up), onLeaveBack (scrolling back above)
  - `toggleActions` is NOT a valid property for ScrollTrigger.batch() - use individual callbacks instead
  - `ScrollTrigger.batch()` returns an array of ScrollTrigger instances that must be tracked for cleanup
  - The portfolio cards already existed in HTML from US-003 with `.portfolio-card` class and number badges
  - Batch animations create smoother performance for large sets of elements (15+ cards)

## [2026-01-29] - US-015
- Implemented Portfolio infinite horizontal marquee animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added `marqueeRowRef` with useRef to track the marquee row DOM element
- Created separate useGSAP hook with scope: marqueeRowRef for proper cleanup
- Infinite horizontal scroll animation: xPercent from 0 to -50
- Duration: 20s, ease: none, repeat: -1 for seamless continuous loop
- Scroll direction: left (xPercent goes from 0 to negative)
- Browser verified: marquee scrolls left continuously, transform values show loop (e.g., -46% → -13%)
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Infinite marquee uses xPercent animation instead of scrollTrigger - it's a continuous animation independent of scroll
  - xPercent: 0 to -50 creates perfect loop when content is duplicated (50% shift = one full content width)
  - ease: none ensures constant speed without acceleration/deceleration
  - repeat: -1 creates infinite loop that restarts automatically when animation completes
  - The marquee HTML already had duplicated content from US-003 (all 15 companies listed twice)
  - Use separate ref (marqueeRowRef) for the marquee element since it's different from the portfolio grid
  - Browser verification: check transform value at different times to confirm continuous scrolling and looping
---
## [2026-01-29] - US-016
- Implemented Portfolio card hover effects in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added `grayscale` filter to logo div with `group-hover:grayscale-0` for color reveal on hover
- Logo text color transitions from zinc-600 to orange-500 on hover
- Card scales to 1.05 on hover using `hover:scale-105`
- Border color transitions from zinc-800 to orange-500 (changed from orange-500/50)
- Corner accent opacity transitions from 0 to 1 (already implemented, verified working)
- All transitions use `duration-200` (0.2s) per acceptance criteria
- Browser verified: grayscale(1) initially, grayscale(0) on hover, orange-500 border/text color, corner opacity 1
- Typecheck passed
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind's `grayscale` filter applies grayscale(1) by default, `grayscale-0` removes it
  - `hover:scale-105` is the Tailwind utility for scaling to 1.05 on hover
  - Border color should use full `hover:border-orange-500` not `hover:border-orange-500/50` for complete effect
  - Agent-browser `find first` command with `hover` action correctly simulates hover and activates CSS group-hover states
  - To verify CSS hover states, use `find first ".selector" hover` then check `window.getComputedStyle()` for the hovered values
  - Wait 300ms after hover action to allow CSS transitions to complete before checking styles
---

## [2026-01-29] - US-017
- Implemented News staggered list reveal animation in `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`
- Added `newsRef` with useRef to track News section DOM element
- Created separate useGSAP hook with scope: newsRef for proper cleanup
- 6 news cards cascade in from bottom to top with staggered reveal
- Initial state: y: 60, opacity: 0
- Animate to: y: 0, opacity: 1
- Stagger: 0.15s per card, ease: power3.out
- ScrollTrigger: start: 'top center', toggleActions: 'play none none reverse'
- Browser verified: all 6 cards reach opacity 1 and y 0 after scroll trigger
- Typecheck passed
- Files changed: `src/app/dwf-labs/page.tsx`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - News cards already existed in HTML from US-003 with `.news-card` class
  - Staggered reveal uses standard gsap.to() with stagger option for sequential animation
  - power3.out is smooth for list reveals (less aggressive than back.out for text)
  - ScrollTrigger with toggleActions: 'play none none reverse' provides proper enter/exit behavior
  - Each card animates 150ms after the previous one (6 cards × 0.15s = 0.75s total duration)
  - Agent-browser eval with Array.from() and map() provides structured data from multiple elements
  - Use `document.querySelector('#section-id').scrollIntoView()` to trigger scroll-based animations during testing
